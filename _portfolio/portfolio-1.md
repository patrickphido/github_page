title: "Team Cambridge Project Demo"
excerpt: "This project is a secure approval workflow system built for University of Houston users. It supports Cougar ID-only login, organizes users by department hierarchy, and routes submitted forms to the correct approvers based on unit or organizational level. Approvers can delegate authority, admins can dynamically manage workflows, and the system generates final PDF forms automatically using LaTeX. A reporting dashboard provides real-time visibility into all submissions, approvals, and rejections."
